        <p>A meeting of the community members was held today on 23rd June 2024 at Poshbab ashram chinore. It was attended by a good number of people and there was a threadbare discussion regarding the renovation work which will be started once we update bank account of Asthapna Sudhar Samati and start Contributions.</p>
        <p>In this regard it was decided by the committee headed by Sh Ram Krishan Raina (president) that Sh. Ashok Pandita (treasurer) shall make the bank account ready for receiving online Contributions by doing the needful at their end. Once the account becomes active, it will be available on our website which is in making. It was also decided to start renovation work once we get a good amount from Contributions. Hope all Nunar Baradari will take interest and help to make this mission successful.</p>
